# Review

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

# Structure in HTML

# Activity: Build Your Own Website!

## Activity, Step One: Analyze

-   Download <a href="7_mock_site.html" download>this `html` file</a> and analyze its code.
-   Identify how to:
    -   emphasize a word
    -   make a word 'strong'
    -   add an html link to a word or string of words
    -   add an image
    -   add an unordered list

## Activity, Step Two: Build

-   Create `firstname_lastname.html`. Add to it: <span style="font-size:80%;">
    1.  A head and body.
    2.  Two `<p>` elements talking about yourself (or whatever you want). Use `<h1>` and `<h2>`.
    3.  Emphasize one word and make another word strong.
    4.  Add a link that points to your GitHub profile.
    5.  Add an image of yourself (or whatever you want).
    6.  Add a simple unordered list (`<ul>`).
    7.  Save and view the file by, "Open with Browser."
    8.  Sync with your GitHub. </span>
