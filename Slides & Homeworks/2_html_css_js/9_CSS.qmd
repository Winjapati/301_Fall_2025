# Review

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

## Review from Days 1 & 2

-   Day 1:

    -   We learned **basic tags**: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
    -   We practiced **attributes** like `href` and `alt`

-   Day 2:

    -   Structure!

-   We built a simple page with our name, a paragraph, a link, an image, and a list, and then structured it.

# Let's Make Things Pretty

## What is CSS?

## CSS syntax basics

- Open up ```firstname_lastname.html```
- Right after ```<html>```, paste:

```html
<head>
<style>
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} 
</style>
</head>
```
