# Review

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

## Review from Days 1 & 2

-   Day 1:

    -   We learned **basic tags**: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
    -   We practiced **attributes** like `href` and `alt`

-   Day 2:

    -   Structure!

-   We built a simple page with our name, a paragraph, a link, an image, and a list, and then structured it.

# Let's Make Things Pretty

## What is CSS?

-   There is a default way that text is displayed on a website: size of H1, organization of lists, etc.
-   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow us to make websites more interesting
    -   Change the color and size of text, such as headings and links
    -   Create layouts to organize content, create multi-column texts or organizing your site in a specific way
    -   Create animations
-   The following exercises are taken from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/)

## CSS syntax basics

-   Open up `firstname_lastname.html`
-   Right after `<html>`, paste:

``` html
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
</style>
</head>
```

## Let's add this to the `<style>` section.

``` html
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} 
```

## Let's add this to the `<style>` section.

``` html
p {
  color: aqua;
  padding: 5px;
  background: midnightblue;
}
```

## Creating a `.css` file

-   Let's now create a new files, called \`\``styles.css`\`\``.  Paste both styles we established above`
