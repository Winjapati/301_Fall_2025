# Review

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

## Review from Days 1, 2, & 3

-   Days 1-2:

    -   We learned **basic tags**: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
    -   We practiced **attributes** like `href` and `alt`
    -   Structure: `<head>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

-   Days 3-4:

    -   CSS
    -   GitHub Pages

# Trying Out Some **Real** Coding

## Recall: Footers

``` html
  </main>
  ...
    <footer>
      © 2025 Andrew M. Byrd · <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
    </footer>
</body>
```

- So... we have to update our website every year with the correct year?

## Date Automated

```html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Your Name</p>
</footer>

<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

## Let's Look at this More Closely

```html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Your Name</p>
</footer>
```

- This is the `<footer>` code. Before we typed "2025".
- <span id="year"></span> is the code that is giving us the correct value
- id="year" is a **variable** defined in the JavaScript code

## What is JavaScript?

- **JavaScript** (JS) is a very popular programming language;
- Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your site;
- Runs in the browser, so no installation needed;
- We’ll use it for small, useful effects on our personal website.

## The `<script>`

```html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

- Embedded in your html file is a **script**
- Scripts are instructions that we give to programming languages

## The `<script>`

```html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

- `const` is one way that JS defines a **variable**
- The variable here is **constant** (hence `const`)
- `year` is that name that **we** give to the variable; `Span` is required in calling up that variable in our script
    - we could call it `cookie`, `nananananana`, whatever!
    - so why not call it `nananananana`?
    
## The `<script>`

```html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

- `document.getElementById("year")`

  - Looks through the HTML and finds the element with id="year".
  - That’s the <span> inside the footer.
  - The result is stored in a constant named yearSpan.

## The `<script>`

```html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

- `new Date()`

  - Creates a JavaScript Date object representing “right now.”

- `.getFullYear()`

  - pulls just the 4-digit year (e.g., 2025) from that Date.

- `yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();`

  - Inserts that year as text into the `<span>`.

## Activity: Let's Modify Your Website!

- In your LIN_301 "staging" folder, modify your `firstname_lastname.html` doc
- Modify your `<footer>`
- Add the `<script>`
  - Place at the bottom of `<body>`, right before `</body>`
- Save, stage, commit, push!
- Test it. Does it work?


# Another JS Script: Dark Mode

## Dark Mode


✅ Each student will see the count go up every time they reload their page.

Activity 3: Something Fun & Useful

A “dark mode toggle” is great for personal sites:

<button id="darkModeBtn">Toggle Dark Mode</button>

<script>
  const btn = document.getElementById("darkModeBtn");
  btn.onclick = () => {
    document.body.classList.toggle("dark");
  };
</script>


In your CSS:

.dark {
  background-color: #222;
  color: #eee;
}


✅ Students can switch their site between light/dark with one click.

## Activity: Add Dark Mode
