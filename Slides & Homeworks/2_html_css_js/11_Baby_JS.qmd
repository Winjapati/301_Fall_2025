# Review

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

## Review from Days 1, 2, & 3

-   Days 1-2:

    -   We learned **basic tags**: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
    -   We practiced **attributes** like `href` and `alt`
    -   Structure: `<head>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

-   Days 3-4:

    -   CSS
    -   GitHub Pages

# Trying Out Some **Real** Coding

## Recall: Footers

``` html
  </main>
  ...
    <footer>
      © 2025 Andrew M. Byrd · <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
    </footer>
</body>
```

-   So... we have to update our website every year with the correct year?

## Date Automated

``` html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Your Name</p>
</footer>

<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

## Let's Look at this More Closely

``` html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Your Name</p>
</footer>
```

-   This is the `<footer>` code. Before we typed "2025".
-   `<span id="year"></span>` is the code that is giving us the correct value
-   id="year" is a **variable** defined in the JavaScript code

## What is JavaScript?

-   **JavaScript** (JS) is a very popular programming language;
-   Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your site;
-   Runs in the browser, so no installation needed;
-   We’ll use it for small, useful effects on our personal website.

## The `<script>`

``` html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

-   Embedded in your html file is a **script**
-   Scripts are instructions that we give to programming languages

## The `<script>`

``` html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

-   `const` is one way that JS defines a **variable**
-   The variable here is **constant** (hence `const`)
-   `year` is that name that *we* give to the variable; `Span` is required in calling up that variable in our script
    -   we could call it `cookie`, `nananananana`, whatever!
    -   so why not call it `nananananana`?

## The `<script>`

``` html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

-   `document.getElementById("year")`

    -   Looks through the HTML and finds the element with id="year".
    -   That’s the `<span>` inside the footer.
    -   The result is stored in a constant named `yearSpan`.

## The `<script>`

``` html
<script>
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

-   `new Date()`

    -   Creates a JavaScript Date object representing “right now.”

-   `.getFullYear()`

    -   pulls just the 4-digit year (e.g., 2025) from that Date.

-   `yearSpan.textContent = new Date().getFullYear();`

    -   Inserts that year as text into the `<span>`.

## Activity: Let's Modify Your Website!

-   In your LIN_301 "staging" folder, modify your `firstname_lastname.html` doc
-   Modify your `<footer>`
-   Add the `<script>`
    -   Place at the bottom of `<body>`, right before `</body>`
-   Save, stage, commit, push!
-   Test it. Does it work?

# Another JS Script: Dark Mode

## Dark Mode

-   Let's add a "Dark Mode" button toggle to our website
-   Here is a link to some code for a standalone site:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<style>
body {
  padding: 25px;
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
  font-size: 25px;
}

.dark-mode {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Toggle Dark/Light Mode</h2>
<p>Click the button to toggle between dark and light mode for this page.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Toggle dark mode</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
   var element = document.body;
   element.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Activity: Dark Mode

-   Add Dark Mode to your Own Website
-   Test: is it possible to use different colors?
-   Look carefully at the code. With your neighbors, try to figure out exactly what each word (like `function`) is doing.
-   After discussing this, google each term. Do they mean what you thought they did?
