1.  What is the difference between the following outputs (if any)?

``` latex
Text$_{subscript}$  
Text\textsubscript{subscript}  
```

2.  What is the difference between the following outputs (if any)?

``` latex
\textit{words in italics}
%%%%%%%%%%%% here's a comment break for legibility %%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{it}
words in italics
\end{it}
```

3.  Below I've pasted some LaTeX code to create a basic table.

<strong> Edit the code to: </strong>

(a) Have the first column be center-aligned, and the second be right-aligned.
(b) Add horizontal lines between each row in the table.

``` latex
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
Apples & Green \\
Strawberries & Red \\
Oranges & Orange \\
\end{tabular}
```

4.  **True** or **False**: in LaTeX, your bibliography is added at the end of the `main.tex` file, just after `\end{document}`
