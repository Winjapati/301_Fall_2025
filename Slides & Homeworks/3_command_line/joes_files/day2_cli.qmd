format: revealjs

# Why the CLI?
- Same computer, just text instead of icons
- Faster, scriptable, reproducible
- Works on macOS, Windows, Linux, servers

---

# The prompt
- Where you type commands (`$`, `%`, or `>`)
- The shell interprets a line as **one command**

---

# Know where you are
```bash
pwd   # present working directory (absolute path)
ls    # list files/directories here
```
Use these **constantly** to keep bearings.

---

# Move around
```bash
cd Documents        # down one level
cd ..               # up one level
cd Documents/html   # down multiple levels
cd ~                # home
```

Tips:
- **Tab autocomplete** for names
- After actions: run `pwd` and `ls`

---

# Activity (6–10 min)
- Open Terminal/PowerShell
- Navigate to a practice folder using `cd`
- Use `pwd` + `ls` after every step
