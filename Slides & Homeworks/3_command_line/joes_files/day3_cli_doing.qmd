# Why do things?
- Navigating is boring
- Let’s **do** something with files

---

# Download a text (Project Gutenberg)
```bash
wget https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt
mv 1342-0.txt PandP.txt
```

---

# `less`: view text
```bash
less PandP.txt
```
- Scroll: arrows / space
- Quit with `q`

---

# `wc`: counts
```bash
wc PandP.txt        # lines, words, chars
wc -l PandP.txt     # lines only
wc -w PandP.txt     # words only
```

---

# `grep`: search inside files
```bash
grep "yes" PandP.txt
```
- Computers are literal → also finds **eyes**
- Precision will come from **regex**

---

# Pipes: chain small tools
```bash
grep "yes" PandP.txt | wc -l
```
- `grep` → matches
- `|` → send output forward
- `wc -l` → count lines

---

# Activity (6–10 min)
- Count lines containing **Elizabeth**:
```bash
grep "Elizabeth" PandP.txt | wc -l
```
- Find the **top 10** most common 3-letter words (hint: Day 4 tools)
