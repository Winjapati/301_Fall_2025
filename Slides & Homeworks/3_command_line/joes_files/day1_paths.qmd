title: "Day 1 — Files & Paths"
format: revealjs
---

# Why files & paths?
- Programs need **directions** to find your stuff
- Most beginner errors = path errors (`file not found`)
- Foundation for HTML/CSS, Python, R, Git, Quarto

---

# All files live in folders
- Desktop is a folder; Documents is a folder
- Files are nested in a **hierarchy** (folders inside folders)
- You always have a *current* folder (context)

---

# Viewing the hierarchy
**macOS Finder**
- View → **as Columns**
- View → **Show Path Bar**

**Windows Explorer**
- Use the **path bar** at the top to see nesting

---

# Relative vs Absolute paths
- **Relative**: from *here* to *there*
- **Absolute**: full path from the drive root

**macOS**: `/Users/Name/Documents/project/style.css`  
**Windows**: `C:\Users\Name\Documents\project\style.css`

# HTML example: linking CSS
Same folder:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Nested folder:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
```

---

# Naming matters
- Avoid spaces in file/folder names
- Prefer: `my_file.txt`, `my-file.txt`, or `myFile.txt`

---

# Activity (5–8 min)
- Create a folder with `index.html` and `style.css`
- Move `style.css` into `assets/` then `assets/css/`
- **Fix the link** in `index.html` each time
