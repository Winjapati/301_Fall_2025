# Schedule & Timing

- Presentations will take place over the last two class days.
- **Talk length:** 7 minutes of presenting + 1 minute for questions.
- Be prepared to present on either day in case we need to shift the schedule.

# Project Website (Instead of Slides)

Instead of a slide deck, you will build a small **project website** and present it to the class.  
This site will be hosted on your **GitHub Pages** site (`username.github.io`).

## Basic Requirements

- Your project must be presented as a **website** (HTML/CSS; Quarto optional).
- The site must be publicly accessible at your GitHub Pages URL.
- The project must contain at least **three clearly separated sections**:
  - **Dataset**
  - **Methods**
  - **Results & Interpretation**

## Suggested Structure

You can structure this as multiple pages or as a single page with good navigation.

### 1. Home / Overview

- Project title and your name.
- Short summary of your research question or goal.
- Outline of the site (what’s on each page/section).

### 2. Dataset

- Which text(s) you chose and why.
- Language(s), source(s), and approximate size (words, chapters, sections).
- How you cleaned the data (tokenization, normalization, encoding issues).
- Any problems you ran into and how you handled them.

### 3. Methods

- What you did in Python, in plain language.
- Examples: token and type counts, TTR, frequency lists, POS tagging, lemmatization, dependencies.
- spaCy or WordNet analyses you used.
- Any custom function(s) you wrote and what they were for.
- You can include small code snippets, but focus on what the code *does*.
- Discuss any outside help that you received, such as from an LLM, Stack Overflow, or a friend.

### 4. Results & Interpretation

- At least **one visualization** embedded in the page.
- Key numerical results (counts, ratios, patterns, comparisons).
- Clear explanation of what the results **mean**, not just what they are.
- Discussion of why you think these patterns appear:
  - language properties  
  - translation choices  
  - stylistic differences  
- Short “What I’d do next” section.

# Presenting Your Website

- During your 7-minute talk, you will **navigate your website** on the screen.
- Use it to guide your story:
  - Overview → Dataset → Methods → Results & Interpretation.
- Don't read the site word-for-word!

# Design Expectations

- The site does **not** need to be fancy, but it must be:
  - Readable (good contrast, clear font sizes).
  - Organized (headings, sections).
  - Easy to navigate (links or a simple nav bar).
- Basic CSS is encouraged.
- You should avoid huge walls of text.

# Delivery Expectations

- Stay within the time limit: 7 minutes + 2 minutes for questions.
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace.
- Assume your audience knows the course tools but not your project.
- Focus on reasoning, not just procedure.

# What Will Be Graded

- **Clarity:** How clearly you explain your project and guide us through the site.
- **Technical understanding:** You understand what your code and metrics do.
- **Quality of analysis:** Thoughtfulness of results and interpretation.
- **Website quality:** Readability, organization, navigation, design.
- **Professionalism:** Timing, preparation, and delivery.

# What to Submit

- Before talks are held (final week of class), submit to Canvas: 
  - a link to your **live GitHub Pages project site**  
  (e.g., `https://username.github.io/project-name/`).
  - a link to your **GitHub repository** containing all project files.
