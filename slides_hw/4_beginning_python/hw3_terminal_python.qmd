# Part 1: Terminal (Setup)

1. Open your Terminal in RStudio.  
2. Navigate (`cd`) into your course repo folder (`LIN_301`).  
3. Make a new folder called `hw3_files`.
4. Download the file **shakespeare.txt** from Project Gutenberg into that folder (use `curl`). The file is located at this address: https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt.  
5. Confirm the file is in your folder with the `ls` command.

# Part 2: Python (Lists and Dictionaries)

Create a new Quarto doc called **hw3.qmd** with a Python code chunk.  

## Load the File

In the first part of your Quarto doc, run the following code. This assigns the text found in `shakespeare.txt` to a variable named `text`.

``` python
with open("hw3_files/shakespeare.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

## Make a List

- Using the method `.split()[:1000]`, take the first 1000 words (in the order they appear) and store them in a list called `first_words`.  
- Print the list.
- Print the 500th item in the list.

## Narrowing down the List

- Now pick **10 of the words** from your `first_words` list. You should pick super common ones (like 'the') and rarer ones, too.
- Manually place these 10 words in a new list called `chosen_ones`.

## Make a Dictionary

- You're now going to create a third list, called `bill`, that will contain *all* of the words of Shakespeare. As before, use the method `.split()` to split `shakespeare.txt` into separate words.
- Use the method `.count()` to see how many times each chosen appears in the newly created list.  
- Create a dictionary called `word_counts` that pairs each chosen word with its number. 
- Do **not** manually insert the counts in your `dict`. You should use the format: `"word": bill.count("word")`.

# Part 3: Reflection

At the bottom of your **hw3.qmd**, write a short (3â€“5 sentence) reflection:

- What was easiest about this assignment?  
- What was hardest?  
- How might a linguist use lists and dictionaries for language data?

# Submission

- Upload **hw3.qmd** file to Canvas.
