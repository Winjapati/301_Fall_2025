# Step 1: check if word starts with a voiceless stop
starts_p = word[0] == "p"
starts_t = word[0] == "t"
starts_k = word[0] == "k"

# Step 2: decide aspiration (simplified: only if itâ€™s the first sound)
aspirated = starts_p or starts_t or starts_k

print("Word:", word)
print("Aspirated?", aspirated)
