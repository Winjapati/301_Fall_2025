# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Recap from Last Time

## Data Structures

Recap from last module: 

- Assign a value to a variable with `=`\
- **Numbers**: `integer` and `float`\
- **Strings**: text inside quotes `"..."` or `'...'`\
- **Booleans**: `True` and `False`, used for logical comparisons

Example:

``` python
this_class = "LIN_301"
this_class == "LIN_305"
# False
```

## Recap from Last Time

We also learned some useful tricks:

- `word[0]`
- `input()`

# Lists

## Lists & Dictionaries

Today, we'll be examining two *very* important data structures in Python: **lists** and **dictionaries**.

## Moving from Variables to Lists

- We can assign a single value to a variable:

``` python
first_novel = "Sense and Sensibility"
```

- But what if we wanted to create a variable called `novels` with multiple values?
- For this we can create a **list**
    - Marked in Python in brackets `[...]`
    - **Ordered** (the order of items is preserved)
    - You can delete and add values within them

## Creating a List

- Jane Austen published **seven novels**. Instead of lots of variables, use a **list**:

``` python
novels = ["Sense and Sensibility", "Pride and Prejudice", "Mansfield Park", "Emma", "Northanger Abbey", "Persuasion", "Lady Susan"]
```

Print list:

``` python
print(novels)
```

## The `+` Operator

``` python
1 + 1
"Dr." + " " + Andrew" + " " + "Byrd"
```

## Adding Two Lists Together

We can also use `+` to **concatenate** lists:

``` python
unfinished = ["The Watsons", "Sandition"]
novels + unfinished
```

## Recall the Activity from Last Time:

``` python
word = "pin"
print(word[0])
```
- What is printed?
- The number within the brackets `[ ... ]` is called the **index** 

## Indexing a List

- Just like `word[0]`, we access the first element of a list with the index `[0]`.

``` python
novels[0]  # first item
novels[1]  # second item
```

- Try:

``` python
novels[6]
```

## How about the reverse?

- Before we wanted to find out what the **7th** novel was by using novels[6].
- But what if we wanted to find out the index of a particular novel? (Such as *Lady Susan*)

## Getting the Index of a Value

- We can use the **method** of a value.
    - Methods are indicated with `.method`
    - `value.method`
- Let's use the `list.index()` method to identify the index
    
``` python
novels.index("Lady Susan")
# 6
```


## Aligning lists using indices

- We can use the index of one list to align with another list

``` python
pub_year = [1811, 1813, 1814, 1815, 1818, 1818, 1871]
susan_index = novels.index("Lady Susan")
pub_year[susan_index]  # 1871
```

- What is this code really doing?

## Reverse Lookup

- We could do the reverse, and find a specific book by year:

``` python
year_index = pub_year.index(1814)
novels[year_index]
# 'Mansfield Park'
```

- What happens if we use `1818` as the index? 

## Negative Indexing

We can also count from the end:

``` python
novels[-1]
# 'Lady Susan'
```

## Activity

- Below is a list of novels written by George Orwell. Copy and paste this code to create both lists in your `qmd`.

``` python
orwell_novels = ["Animal Farm", "Nineteen Eighty-Four", "Burmese Days", "Keep the Aspidistra Flying", "Coming Up for Air"]
pub_year = [1945, 1949, 1934, 1936, 1939]
```

- Next, do the following:
1. Print the names of the first and last novel.
2. Use `.index()` to find the position of *Burmese Days*. Use that index to print the corresponding publication year from `pub_year`.
3. Find which novel was published in `1936`.

# Other Useful List Operations

## Slicing

- Let's return to Austen's `novels`
- We can ranges of values in lists, using the `:` symbol:

``` python
novels[0:3]
# ['Sense and Sensibility', 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Mansfield Park']
```

- Note: the stop index is not included!  (It's not 0-3, it's 0-2)

## Membership Test

- We can also check to see if a value is in a list using the operator `in`

``` python
"Emma" in novels          # True
"Frankenstein" in novels  # False
```

- Or with a variable:

``` python
novel_to_check = "Lady Susan"
novel_to_check in novels
```

## Complex Lists

- Lists can contain pretty much anything — even other lists:

``` python
complex_list = [["Sense and Sensibility", 1811],
                ["Pride and Prejudice", 1813],
                ["Mansfield Park", 1814],
                ["Emma", 1815]]
```

## Indexing in Complex Lists

``` python
complex_list[0]      # ["Sense and Sensibility", 1811]
complex_list[2][1]   # 1814
```

- Having a way to have two members within a list would be super useful for linguists
- Languages do have lexicons after all!
    - form : meaning


# Dictionaries

- There's a more straight-forward way to do this in Python
- We can use `dict` (**dictionaries**)
- Pythons `dict` is marked not with `[...]`, but with curly braces `{...}`
- Note: entries are **unordered**.

## Dictionaries

- We can relate **keys** (the first member) to **values** (the second) using `{}`:

``` python
novel_dict = {"Sense and Sensibility": 1811,
              "Pride and Prejudice": 1813,
              "Mansfield Park": 1814}
```

- Note the structure { key_0 : value_0, key_1 : value_1, etc.}

## Keys & Values

- Keys must be unique, but values can repeat.

``` python
austen_dict = {
    "Sense and Sensibility": 1811,
    "Pride and Prejudice": 1813,
    "Mansfield Park": 1814,
    "Emma": 1815,
    "Northanger Abbey": 1818,   # duplicate value
    "Persuasion": 1818,         # duplicate value
    "Lady Susan": 1871
}
```

## Indexing a Dictionary

- Get values by key:

``` python
austen_dict["Pride and Prejudice"]
# 1813
```

- Note: it's easy to find the value of a key, but the opposite is much trickier.
  - Why might that be so?

## Adding to a Dictionary

- To add a new key–value pair, use the following dict["new_key"] = new_value

``` python
austen_dict["The Rise of Han Solo"] = 2025
```

## Overwriting a key's value

- To change the value of a key, you simply restate it:

    - `dict["key"] = changed_value`

``` python
austen_dict["The Rise of Han Solo"] = 1872
```


## Deleting a `key`-`value` Pair from the Dictionary

- To delete a `key`-`value` pair:
    - `del dict["key"]`
    
    
``` python
del austen_dict["The Rise of Han Solo"]
```

## Checking Keys

- We can use `in` checks to check `keys` (but not `values`)!

``` python
"Pride and Prejudice" in austen_dict  # True
1811 in austen_dict                   # False
```

## Dictionary Activity

- Below is a dictionary pairing George Orwell’s novels with their publication years. Copy this into your qmd:

``` python
orwell_dict = {
    "Animal Farm": 1945,
    "Nineteen Eighty-Four": 1949,
    "Burmese Days": 1934,
    "Keep the Aspidistra Flying": 1936,
    "Coming Up for Air": 1939
}
```

## Dictionary Activity

- Print the year that *Animal Farm* was published using its key.
- Check if *Homage to Catalonia* is in the dictionary. 
- Add Orwell’s *Homage to Catalonia* (1937) to the dictionary. Print the dictionary again to confirm.
- Whoops, made a mistake! *Homage to Catalonia* was actually published in 1938. Fix that mistake.
- Remove *Coming Up for Air* from the dictionary.

# Lists vs. Dictionaries

When should use lists? Dictionaries?

## When to Use Lists

- You care about order (wordlists, texts, morpheme sequences).
- You want to access items by position (index):
    - e.g., `ipa_segments[0]` → first sound in a word.
- If you don't care about *or* have duplicates
    - e.g., a corpus may have the same word many times

Examples:

``` python
words = ["dog", "dog", "cat", "horse"]
morphemes = ["un", "believe", "able"]
```

## When to Use Dictionaries

- You want to map one kind of information to another (`key` : `value`).
- Order is not important, but fast lookup is.
- Your entries (`keys`) are unique, though values can repeat.

Examples:

``` python
#Mapping languages to families:
lang_family = {"Latin": "Indo-European", "Finnish": "Uralic"}

#Mapping words to glosses:
lexicon = {"amo": "I love", "amas": "you love", "amat": "(s)he loves"}
```

## To Sum Up

- List = a sequence you want to keep in order (words, morphemes, phonemes).
- Dict = a mapping between two things (form → gloss, language → family, word → year).

# Activities Answers

## Activity 1

``` python
# 1. First and last novel
print(orwell_novels[0])    # Animal Farm
print(orwell_novels[-1])   # Coming Up for Air

# 2. Publication year of Burmese Days
burm_index = orwell_novels.index("Burmese Days")
print(pub_year[burm_index])   # 1934

# 3. Which novel was published in 1936?
index_1936 = pub_year.index(1936)
print(orwell_novels[index_1936])   # Keep the Aspidistra Flying
```

## Activity 2

``` python
# 1. Direct lookup
print(orwell_dict["Animal Farm"])     # Output: 1945

# 2. Membership check
print("Homage to Catalonia" in orwell_dict)   # Output: False


# 3. Adding a new key–value pair
orwell_dict["Homage to Catalonia"] = 1937
print(orwell_dict)      # Now includes: "Homage to Catalonia": 1937


# 4. Overwriting a value (fixing a mistake)
orwell_dict["Homage to Catalonia"] = 1938   # reassigns the correct year
print(orwell_dict["Homage to Catalonia"])   # Output: 1938


# 5. Delete a key–value pair
del orwell_dict["Coming Up for Air"]
print(orwell_dict)        # "Coming Up for Air" has been removed
```
