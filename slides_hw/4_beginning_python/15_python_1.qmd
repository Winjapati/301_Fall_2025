# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Review: `wc`, `grep`, and `|`

-   `wc file.txt` → identify number of lines, words, and characters in `file.txt`
    -   `-l`, `-w`, `-c`
-   `grep "word" file.txt` → search for a string in a file
-   Combine with pipes:
    -   `grep "word" file.txt | wc -l`

## Review Activity

Using Terminal:

-   Create a folder called `alice`
-   Download *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*
    -   https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11
    -   name it `alice.txt`
-   Search for "Alice"
-   How many instances of "Alice" are there in the story? (Or more specifically, how many lines occur in the book that contain at least one "Alice"?)
