4.  Below is some code to generate phonological rules in LaTeX.

    ``` latex
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{phonrule} #phonological rule package
    \usepackage{tipa}
    
    \begin{document}
    \begin{enumerate} 
    \item \phonb{s}{z}{V}{V} (\textbackslash phonb) 
    \item \phonl{k}{c}{i} (\textbackslash phonl) 
    \item \phonr{t}{ts}{u} (\textbackslash phonr) 
    \item \phon{\textturnw}{w} (\textbackslash phon) 
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{document}
    ```
    
    What do the letters `b`, `l`, and `r` refer to in the `\phon` command?
