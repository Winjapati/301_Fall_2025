# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Review: `wc`, `grep`, and `|`

-   `wc file.txt` → identify number of lines, words, and characters in `file.txt`
    -   `-l`, `-w`, `-c`
-   `grep "word" file.txt` → search for a string in a file
-   Combine with pipes:
    -   `grep "word" file.txt | wc -l`

## Review Activity

Using Terminal:

-   Create a folder called `alice`
-   Download *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*
    - https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11
    - name it `alice.txt`
-   Search for "Alice"
-   How many instances of "Alice" are there in the story? (Or more specifically, how many lines occur in the book that contain at least one "Alice"?)

# Regex

## What Are Regular Expressions?

-   A **language for patterns**
    -   Pronounced \[ˌɹɛg.ˈɛks\]
-   Lets us search for:
    -   Word forms
    -   Phonological environments
    -   Structured data

## Regular Expressions are WEIRD

-   Of all the programming we'll be doing in this class, (I think) regex is the most obtuse

-   Today we'll learn how basic regex commands can be used in the Terminal

-   And we'll likely return to them later in the semester once we have some Python under our belts

## Our First Regex

-   Type in the following code:

``` bash
grep -E "c.t" alice.txt
```

-   Note the `-E`
    -   This prompts `grep` to use **Extended Regular Expressions**
-   What does `.` do?

## Useful Flags

-   E → extended regex
-   o → print only matches
-   c → count matches

``` bash
grep -Eo "\w+ing" file.txt
```

## Our First Regex

-   `.` → any single character\

## Narrowing Down our Search

-   So far we're able to identify *any* sequence of the shape "c_t"

``` bash
grep -E "c.t" alice.txt
```
- How else might we want to narrow down our search?

## Narrowing Down our Search

- Perhaps we would want to specify certain vowel letters:

``` bash
grep -E "c[aou]t" alice.txt   
```

## Narrowing Down our Search

- Perhaps we would want to exclude certain vowel letters:

``` bash
grep -E "c[^ao]t" alice.txt
```

## Narrowing Down our Search

- Perhaps we would want to identify a range of certain vowel letters:

``` bash
grep -E "[a-q]at" alice.txt
```

- (Also works for digits: e.g., \[0-9\])

## Narrowing Down our Search

- What if we want to say "begins with `cat`"?


``` bash
grep -E "\scat" alice.txt
```

- How would we say "ends with `cat`"?

## Narrowing Down our Search

- How would we say "either `cat` or `cats`"?

``` bash
grep -E "\scats?" alice.txt
```

## Anchors

-   \^ → beginning of line
-   \$ → end of line

``` bash
grep -E "^c.t" file.txt   # lines starting with "c.t"
grep -E "c.t$" file.txt    # lines ending with "c.t"
```

## Grouping & Alternation

-   "(Alice|Rabbit)" → "Alice" or "Rabbit"
<!-- -   (ab)+ → one or more “ab” sequences -->

``` bash
grep -E "(cat|dog)" file.txt
```



## Narrowing Down our Search

-   Predefined:
    -   `\d` → digit
    -   `\w` → word character
    -   `\s` → whitespace


## More Symbols

-   Within `14_alice.txt`, use the following code.

``` bash
grep -E "c.t" file.txt   # matches cat, cot, cut
```

-   `*` → 0 or more of the preceding\
-   `?` → 0 or 1 of the preceding\
-   `+` → 1 or more of the preceding




## Grep + Regex in Action

Examples with a text file:

-   Words ending in “ing”

``` bash
grep -E "(cat|dog)" file.txt
```

-   Lines starting with a capital letter

``` bash
grep -E "^[A-Z]" file.txt
```

-   All numbers

``` bash
grep -E "[0-9]+" file.txt
```



## Activity

-   Within `alice.txt`, using `grep`/`regex`, find:
    1. All words beginning with "a"/ "A" or "z" / "Z";
    2. All four-letter words;
    3. Lines ending with a question mark (use `\?`);
    4. Words with repeated vowels ("food", "see");
    5. The total number of articles ("the, The, a, A, an, An") in the story.
