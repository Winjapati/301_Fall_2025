# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Review: Grep Basics

- `grep "word" file.txt` → search for a string in a file
- Useful flags:
  - `-i` → ignore case
  - `-n` → show line numbers
  - `-r` → recursive search
- Combine with pipes:
  - `grep "word" file.txt | wc -l`

## What Are Regular Expressions?

- A **language for patterns**
- Lets us search for:
  - Word forms
  - Phonological environments
  - Structured data
- Used in:
  - Linguistics
  - Programming
  - Data science

## Wildcards & Metacharacters

- `.` → any single character  
- `*` → 0 or more of the preceding  
- `?` → 0 or 1 of the preceding  
- `+` → 1 or more of the preceding  

**Example**  
```bash
grep -E "c.t" file.txt   # matches cat, cot, cut
```

- Note the `-E` -- this prompts `grep` to use **Extended Regular Expressions**

## Character Classes


- [aeiou] → any vowel
- [^aeiou] → anything except a vowel
- [a-z], [0-9] → ranges
- Predefined:
  - \d → digit
  - \w → word character
  - \s → whitespace

```bash
grep -E "[0-9]+" file.txt   # find numbers
```

## Anchors 

- ^ → beginning of line
- $ → end of line

```bash
grep -E "^The" file.txt   # lines starting with "The"
grep -E "\?$" file.txt    # lines ending with "?"
```

## Grouping & Alternation

- (cat|dog) → "cat" or "dog"
- (ab)+ → one or more “ab” sequences

```bash
grep -E "(cat|dog)" file.txt
```

## Grep + Regex in Action
Examples with a text file:

- Words ending in “ing”
```bash
grep -E "(cat|dog)" file.txt
```

- Lines starting with a capital letter
```bash
grep -E "^[A-Z]" file.txt
```

- All numbers
```bash
grep -E "[0-9]+" file.txt
```

## Useful Flags

- E → extended regex
- o → print only matches
- c → count matches

```bash
grep -Eo "\w+ing" file.txt
```

## Activity

- Work with a text of your choice (e.g., from Project Gutenberg).
- Try to find:
  - All words beginning with "a"/ "A" or "z" / "Z"
  - All four-letter words
  - Lines ending with a question mark
  - Words with repeated vowels (food, see)
