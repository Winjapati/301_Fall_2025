# Review: HTML, CSS, JS

-   What did you learn last time about HTML?

# Learning the Terminal

## Why start in the terminal?

- Python always runs **in a folder** (working directory).
- If you can move, list, and fetch files here, this will make understanding accessing files easier in Python later.
- Same skills for Git, servers, clusters.

## Navigating the Terminal

- We'll be working within the `Terminal` in RStudio
- You should have the setting "New terminals open with:" = "GitBash".  (Tools > Global Options > Terminal)

** PICTURE HERE**

## Navigating the Terminal

- Let's start with the first command

```bash
pwd         # short for "print working directory"
```

## Navigating the Terminal

- You can also look to see what's in the current directory

```bash
ls           # short for "listing files"
```

## Navigating the Terminal

- Most commands have **options**

```bash
ls -l        # details (permissions, size, dates)
ls -a        # include hidden files (like .git)
```

## Navigating the Terminal

```bash
cd          # short for "change directory"
```

- You need to specify which directory to change into
- For now, use:

```bash
cd ~         
```

## Navigating the Terminal

- Type:

```bash
ls        
```

- Find a directory (dir_name) within it, and type (replacing `dir_name` with the actual directory name):

```bash
cd dir_name        
```
- This should move you "up" into the directory. Verify this is the case with `ls`.

## Navigating the Terminal

```bash
cd projects           # into a folder
cd ..                 # up one
cd ~                  # to home
cd /                  # to filesystem root (Mac/Linux)
cd ~/Desktop          # absolute path to Desktop\
cd "My Folder"        # if there are any spaces in your named folder
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Making & Renaming

-   `mkdir newfolder` ‚Üí make directory
-   `rmdir oldfolder` ‚Üí remove empty directory
-   `mv old.txt new.txt` ‚Üí rename file
-   `mv file.txt folder/` ‚Üí move file

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Activity: Treasure Hunt üóÇÔ∏è

1.  Navigate into the `practice/` folder provided.
2.  Find the file named `clue.txt`.
3.  Open it with `cat clue.txt` ‚Äî it tells you the next file.
4.  First to reach the last file wins!



Day 1: Navigating the Terminal

- changing directories in the terminal, going up, going down, going to specific location
- downloading files using "curl"
- creating a file, deleting a file
- creating a folder, deleting a folder
- writing a .sh script
- activity, integrating all of this


Day 2: File Extensions, Beginning Grep

- review activity: navigating, creating, deleting, .sh
- file extensions, what are they?
- why word and google docs suck for programming
- converting files
- activity
- searching files with wc (-l, -w)
- searching files with grep
- piping
- activity: explore Project Gutenberg, download txt file of choice, place in unique folder, validate each step along the way 

Day 3: Grep and Regex
