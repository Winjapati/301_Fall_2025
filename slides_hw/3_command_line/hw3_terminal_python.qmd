# Part 1: Terminal (Setup)

1. Open your Terminal in RStudio.  
2. Navigate (`cd`) into your course repo folder (e.g., `~/git_repos/301_Fall_2025`).  
3. Make a new folder called `hw2_files`:

```{.bash}
mkdir hw2_files
```

4. Download the file **shakespeare.txt** from Project Gutenberg into that folder (use `curl`):

```{.bash}
curl -o shakespeare.txt https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt
```

5. Confirm the file is in your folder with:

```{.bash}
ls hw2_files
```

# Part 2: Python (Lists and Dictionaries)

Create a new Quarto doc called **hw2.qmd** with a Python code chunk.  

## Load the File

```{python}
with open("hw2_files/shakespeare.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

## Make a List

- Take the first 10 *unique* words from the file (in the order they appear) and store them in a list called `words`.  
- Print the list.  
- Print the 3rd and 7th items in the list.  

Example:

```{python}
words = ["The", "Project", "Gutenberg", "EBook", "of", "William", "Shakespeare", "Complete", "by", "Shakespeare"]
print(words)
print(words[2])   # 3rd item
print(words[6])   # 7th item
```

## Make a Dictionary

- Pick **3 of the words** from your `words` list.  
- Use `.count()` to see how many times each appears in the text.  
- Create a dictionary called `word_counts` that pairs each chosen word with its number.  

Example:

```{python}
word_counts = {
    "The": text.count("The"),
    "Project": text.count("Project"),
    "Shakespeare": text.count("Shakespeare")
}
print(word_counts)
```

# Part 3: Reflection

At the bottom of your **hw2.qmd**, write a short (3â€“5 sentence) reflection:

- What was easiest about this assignment?  
- What was hardest?  
- How might a linguist use lists and dictionaries for language data?  

---

# Submission

- Upload **hw2.qmd** and your **hw2_files/shakespeare.txt** file to your GitHub repo.  
- Post the repo link to Canvas.
