# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Recap from Last Time

-   Conditionals: `if` = 1 x
-   Loops: `for` = multiple times
-   Cleaning text with `.strip()`, `.lower()`

## Review Activity

-   Copy this list of messy words into your code, creating a list called `words`:

``` python
words = [" Cat\n", "dog", " BIRD ", "fish\n", "LION", "tiger ", "bear", "OWL\n"]
```

-   Write a `for` loop that goes through each word. Inside the loop:
    -   Use `.strip()` and `.lower()` to clean the word
    -   Save each result in a variable called `cleaned`
    -   Print each instance of `cleaned` in the loop.

# More Tricks with Lists

## `.append()`

-   In the previous activity, we were able to print up each cleaned word
-   But what if we want the words to remain in a list?
-   For this, we'll use the method `.append()`

``` python
test_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
test_list.append("d")
```

## Review Activity - Revisited

-   Here is one way that we could have done the review activity:

``` python
words = [" Cat\n", "dog", " BIRD ", "fish\n", "LION", "tiger ", "bear", "OWL\n"]

for word in words:
    cleaned = word.strip().lower()
    print(cleaned)
```

## Review Activity - Revisited

-   But how to *maintain* these words in a list?

-   First, more straightforward (but less efficient) way:

``` python
words = [" Cat\n", "dog", " BIRD ", "fish\n", "LION", "tiger ", "bear", "OWL\n"]
cleaned_words = []

for word in words:
    cleaned = word.strip().lower()
    cleaned_words.append(cleaned)

print(cleaned_words)
```

-   Here we used the `.append()` method

## Review Activity - Revisited

-   Second, more efficient but trickier way is to use a **list comprehension**, through which we don't even have to use `.append()`:

``` python
words = [" Cat\n", "dog", " BIRD ", "fish\n", "LION", "tiger ", "bear", "OWL\n"]

cleaned_words = [word.strip().lower() for word in words]

print(cleaned_words)
```

## Counters

-   In Linguistics, we often want to know how many words are in a text or how many sounds are in a word.
-   We could use the `len()` command:

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]
print(len(items))
```

## Counters

-   Or we could create a **counter**, to count how many items are there:

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]

item_count = 0
for item in items:
    item_count += 1
    print(item, item_count)
```

## Counters

-   We can do *much* more interesting things with counters, such as:

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]

c_item_count = 0
for item in items:
    if item[0] == "c":
        c_item_count += 1
        print(item, c_item_count)
```

## Counter Activity

-   Identify how many words end in "r" in the following list:

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]
```

## If you're like me, you might be confused by:

-   Index vs. Integer

``` python
word = "word"
word[0]
numb = 0
```

## `.replace()`

-   Let's return to our `items` list
-   Notice some inconsistencies in spellings?

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]
```

## `.replace()`

-   A method to replace one string with another.

``` python
word = "four"
new_word  = word.replace("our", "or")
print(new_word)
```

## `.replace()`

-   Let's broaden the scope so that it applies to all words ending in "-our"

``` python
items = ["color", "flavour", "theater", "center", "analyze", "organize", "favorite", "neighbor", "honor", "catalog", "honour", "flavor", "analyse", "flavor", "traveler"]

down_with_brits = []
for word in items:
    if word.endswith("our"):
        word = word.replace("our", "or")
    down_with_brits.append(word)

print(down_with_brits)
```

-   Note the `.endswith()` method - there's also `.startswith()`

## `.replace()` Activity

-   Broaden your `if` block to have words ending in "-yse" respelled as "-yze"

## `.split()`

-   We can also take a line of text and split it up into a list.

``` python
getty = "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

getty.split()
```

-   By default, `split()` separates according to whitespace.

## `.split()`

-   But what happens if you do the following?

``` python
getty = "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

getty_1 = getty.split(",")
getty_2 = getty.split(".")
getty_3 = getty.split("e")
print(getty_1, "\n", getty_2, "\n", getty_3)
```

## `re.split()`

-   How would you split according to whitespace *and* punctuation?
-   Our old friend `regex`
-   Create a new `.py` file called `split.py` and paste this code:

``` python
import re

text = "Hello, world!   This... is a test."
words = re.split(r"[\s\W]+", text)
words = [w for w in words if w]   # remove empty strings
print(words)
```

## `re.split()`

``` python
import re

text = "Hello, world!   This... is a test."
words = re.split(r"[\s\W]+", text)
words = [w for w in words if w]   # remove empty strings
print(words)
```

-   `\s` = whitespace
-   `\W` = non-word characters (punctuation, symbols, etc.)
-   `+` = one or more preceding

# `while` Loops

## `while` Loops

-   They're a lot like `if` statements, where something happens if a condition is met:

``` python
x = 0
if x < 10
    print(x, "is less than 10.")
```

## `while` Loops

-   In `while` loops, there's also a logical condition
-   But instead of running the code once, python will loop back and recheck the conditional
-   It will do this **forever** until the conditional returns `False`

``` python
while x < 10:
    print(x, "is less than 10.")
    x = x - 1
```

## `while` Loops

when the condition is True, python runs the indented code once.

x = 0 if x \< 10: print(x, "is less than 10.") In while loops, there is also a logical condition, but instead of running the indented code just once, python loops back and re-checks the conditional. If it's still True, it runs the indented code again, and loops back to re-check the conditional. It will keep doing this forever until the conditional returns False.

while x \< 10: print(x, "is less than 10.") x = x - 1

It is important to write while loops carefully! It is very easy to write a while loop that will accidentally run forever. If you think you've done this, hitting CTRL + c on your keyboard will interrupt the process.

We usually won't be using while in this class. They're mostly used when you want a script to wait for user input. We can do kind of fun looking things with them though.

name = "The University of Kentucky"

while name: print("\|" + name + "\|") name = name\
