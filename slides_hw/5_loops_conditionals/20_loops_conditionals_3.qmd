# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Recap from Last Time

## Data Structures

Recap from last module:

-   Assign a value to a variable with `=`\
-   **Numbers**: `integer` and `float`\
-   **Strings**: text inside quotes `"..."` or `'...'`\
-   **Booleans**: `True` and `False`, used for logical comparisons

Example:

``` python
this_class = "LIN_301"
this_class == "LIN_305"
# False
```

## Recap from Last Time

We also learned some useful tricks:

-   `word[0]`
-   `input()`

While Loops
Another kind of loop is the while loop. These are a lot like if statements. In an if statement, when the condition is True, python runs the indented code once.

x  = 0
if x < 10:
    print(x, "is less than 10.")
In while loops, there is also a logical condition, but instead of running the indented code just once, python loops back and re-checks the conditional. If it's still True, it runs the indented code again, and loops back to re-check the conditional. It will keep doing this forever until the conditional returns False.

while x < 10:
    print(x, "is less than 10.")
    x = x - 1

# 0 is less than 10
# 1 is less than 10
# 2 is less than 10
# 3 is less than 10
# 4 is less than 10
# 5 is less than 10
# 6 is less than 10
# 7 is less than 10
# 8 is less than 10
# 9 is less than 10
It is important to write while loops carefully! It is very easy to write a while loop that will accidentally run forever. If you think you've done this, hitting CTRL + c on your keyboard will interrupt the process.

We usually won't be using while in this class. They're mostly used when you want a script to wait for user input. We can do kind of fun looking things with them though.

name = "The University of Kentucky"

while name:
    print("|" + name + "|")
    name = name[0:-1]
