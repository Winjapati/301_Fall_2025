# Overview

**Goal:** Download a raw conlang wordlist and write Python code to:

1. Strip whitespace and all edge punctuation marks.   
2. Make everything lowercase.  
3. Split into words. 
4. Build two lists:
   - `words_v`: tokens **with at least one vowel**  
   - `words_no_v`: tokens **with no vowels**  
5. Print required summaries.

You’ll be making use of the skills learned in class: `re.split()`, `.lower()`, `.append()`, `for` loops, and conditionals.

You will submit **one** Quarto file named `HW4_Lastname_Firstname.qmd`.

# Step 0 — Download the file (Terminal)

Open the **Terminal** pane in RStudio and download a file called `conlang.txt` using bash `curl`. File located at: https://winjapati.github.io/301_Fall_2025/5_loops_conditionals/conlang.txt.

Place `conlang.txt` in a new subfolder called `hw4_files`.

# Step 1 - Load the text

Next, load your `txt` file within your `qmd` using the `with open...` command.

```python
# 1) Load the raw text
with open("hw4_files/conlang.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

# Step 2 - Normalize + split

Next, using `re.split()`, eliminate all outer whitespace and non-word characters, and use the `.lower()` method while you're at it to make all text lowercase. 

Using a list comprehension, save these words in a list called `words_all`. When you do so, be sure to eliminate any members of the list that are blank.

```python
words_all = [w for w in words_all if w]
```

Verify that you've successfully done so using by typing `words_all[:15]`.

# Step 3 - Filter out words by vowel

Next, place tokens that contain at least one vowel into a new list called `words_v`.  Place tokens that do not have any vowels in a new list called `words_no_V`.

To do this, you will need to follow two steps:

1) Create a `set` of all known vowels that occur in the conlang.

```python
vowels = set("aei...")    # find all of the vowels in the conlang, and list them here.
```

2) Use the `any()` command, which will return `True` if any of the checks inside are `True`.

```python
any(ch in vowels for ch in wd)
```

You will be running this code inside of a conditional, nested inside a `for loop`.

**Hint**: Remember to create empty lists called `words_v` and `words_no_v` beforehand! Otherwise, you'll have nothing to `.append()` to.

# Step 4 - Verify

Run the following script to verify that everything is working properly.

```python
print("First 30 words (with vowels):")
print(words_v[:30])
print()

print("Counts:")
print("  total tokens after edge-punct clean:", len(words_all))
print("  kept (has ≥1 vowel):", len(words_v))
print("  removed (no vowels):", len(words_no_v))
```
