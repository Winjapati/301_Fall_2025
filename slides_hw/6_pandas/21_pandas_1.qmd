# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Recap from Last Time

-   Conditionals: `if` = 1 x
-   Loops: `for` = multiple times
-   Cleaning text with `.strip()`, `.lower()`

## Review Activity

-   Copy this list of messy words into your code, creating a list called `words`:

``` python
words = [" Cat\n", "dog", " BIRD ", "fish\n", "LION", "tiger ", "bear", "OWL\n"]
```

-   Write a `for` loop that goes through each word. Inside the loop:
    -   Use `.strip()` and `.lower()` to clean the word
    -   Save each result in a variable called `cleaned`
    -   Print each instance of `cleaned` in the loop.

# The Big Picture

## What is Pandas?

## What is a **DataFrame**?

- a table - like a spreadsheet

## What is a **Series**?

- a single labeled column or row

- A DF is a collection of Series objects that share the same index

## Example of a DF

```python
data = {"language": ["Latin", "Greek", "Sanskrit"], "family": ["IE", "IE", "IE"]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

# Indexing and Selecting

```python

```

## Accessing One Column

```python

```


## Accessing Multiple Columns

```python

```


## Accessing Row by Label

```python

```


## Accessing Row by Number

```python

```


## Cell Access (Row + Column)

```python

```

## Boolean Filtering

```python

```


# Modifying DFs


## Adding New Columns

```python

```


## Dropping Columns & Rows

```python

```



## Renaming Columns

```python

```


## (Re)setting Indices


```python

```
