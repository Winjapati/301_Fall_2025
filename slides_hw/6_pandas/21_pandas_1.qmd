# Review

-   What did you learn last time?

## Recap from Last Time

-   Conditionals: `if` = 1 x
-   Loops: `for` = multiple times
-   Cleaning text with `.strip()`, `.lower()`

## Review Activity

1. Copy the code below.
2. Use a `for` loop and a conditional to sort each letter of the word "computation" into consonants & vowels.
3. If the character is a vowel, print "x is a vowel." If it is not a vowel, print "x is not a vowel."

```python
word = "computation"
vowels = "aeiou"
```

# Setting up Pandas

## Panda Power

- Python programmers often use **pandas** to sort, create, and analyze tabular data 
- This will allow us to compute data found in spreadsheets, lexica, corpora.
- Note: **pandas** is built on top of a **NumPy** `array`.
  - This package allows you to compute high-level mathematical functions
  - For this reason, you can compute these things within **pandas** as well! (But we won't in 301)

## Installing Pandas

To install:
- PC: 

```bash
pip install pandas
```

- Mac:
```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

## Loading Pandas

- To run in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
```




⚠️ **Avoid file-name shadowing:** Don’t name your scripts `pandas.py`, `re.py`, `random.py`, etc.

# How does Pandas Work?

## What is Pandas?

- **Pandas**, short for **Panel Data**
- Allows the manipulation of tables within Python
  - very similar to a spreadsheet

## What is a **Series**?

- At the heart of a `pd` `df` (pandas dataframe), are **Series**: 
    - 1-D labeled data
    - like an ordered `dict`
    - a single labeled column or row

```python
import pandas as pd

langs = pd.Series(["Latin", "Greek", "Sanskrit"], index=["Italic","Greek","Indic"], name="language")
langs
```

## What is a **DataFrame**?

- You can combine **Series** that share the same index to create a **DataFrame**
  - a 2-D `pd` table

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "language": ["Latin", "Greek", "Sanskrit", "Finnish"],
    "family":   ["Indo-European", "Indo-European", "Indo-European", "Uralic"],
    "speakers_millions": [0, 0, 0, 6],
})
```


## Example of a DF

- A DF is a collection of Series objects that share the same **index**

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "language": ["Latin", "Greek", "Sanskrit", "Finnish"],
    "family":   ["Indo-European", "Indo-European", "Indo-European", "Uralic"],
    "speakers_millions": [0, 0, 0, 6],
})
```

- Run the above code. What are the indices of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rows?

## Activity: Building a `df`

Let’s practice *building* DataFrames from scratch.

- Start with a list of languages:

```python
import pandas as pd

languages = {
    "French": "Romance",
    "Spanish": "Romance",
    "Italian": "Romance",
    "English": "Germanic"
}
lang = [key for key in languages[key]]
```

##

```python
families = ["Romance", "Romance", "Romance", "Germanic"]

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "language": langs,
    "family": families
})

print(df)
```


## Inspecting a DataFrame

- Run this code - what do `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.index` do? 

```python
df.head()
df.tail(2)
df.shape, df.columns, df.index
df.info()
```

## DF Activity

# Indexing and Selecting

## Selecting Columns

```python
df["language"]           # Series
df[["language","family"]]# DataFrame (note double brackets)
```


## Accessing Multiple Columns

```python

```

## Selecting Rows by Integer Position
```python
df.iloc[0]               # first row
df.iloc[1:3]             # slice rows 1..2
```


## Selecting Rows By Label
```python
# Rows by label (after we set a custom index)
df2 = df.copy()
df2.index = ["a","b","c","d"]
df2.loc["b"]             # row labeled 'b'
```


## Cell Access (Row + Column)

```python
df.loc[0, "language"]        # cell by label/column
df.iloc[0, 0]                # cell by position
df.iloc[0:3, 0:2]            # rows 0..2, cols 0..1
```

## Boolean Filtering

```python
ie = df[df["family"] == "Indo-European"]
ie
```

# Modifying DataFrames

## Adding New Columns

```python
df["is_extinct"] = [True, False, False, True]
```



## Dropping Columns & Rows

```python
# Drop (returns a new DF unless inplace=True)
df_no_family = df.drop(columns=["family"])
```



## Renaming Columns

```python
df = df.rename(columns={"speakers_millions": "speakers_M"})
```


## (Re)setting Indices


```python
df_reset = df.reset_index(drop=True)
df_set = df.set_index("language")
df_set
```





## **Day 1 Activity — Mini Lexicon**

Create a small lexicon and practice selection & modification.

```python
lex = pd.DataFrame({
    "Language": ["Latin","Greek","Sanskrit","Old English"],
    "Root": ["fer-","phér-","bhar-","ber-"],
    "Gloss": ["carry","carry","carry","carry"]
})
# Tasks:
# 1) Show only Language + Root
# 2) Add Family = "IE" for all
# 3) Rename Gloss -> Meaning
# 4) Set index to Language, then select the Sanskrit row by label
```

# Activity Answers

## Review Activity

```python
word = "computation"
vowels = "aeiou"

for c in word:
    if c in vowels:
        print(c, "is a vowel.")
    else:
        print(c, "is not a vowel.")
```
