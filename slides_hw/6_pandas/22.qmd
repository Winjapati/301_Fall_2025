# Activity: Detective Gutenberg

## Detective Gutenberg

**Goal:** discover what makes an author’s writing style distinctive using the Python tools you already know. 

  - If you don't remember how to do something, revisit past lectures.

**Last time:**
 
 - Downloaded two files, loaded & cleaned them.
 - Counted how many words there were (total \& unique).

**Today, you'll:**
  
- Measure style and print up the results.

## Overview of Activity — Explore the Data

2. What is the **average word length**?
3. How many **adverbs** are there? Pick **three other affixes** to investigate.
4. How much **dialogue** is there? (Use `quot_list = ['"', '“', '”']`)
5. What are the **most common words** (excluding “the,” “and,” “of”)? Arrange your values with `sorted(dict_name.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`

## If You Finish Early

- Add a third author (Dickens, Poe, Twain)  
- Feel free to add yourself as the third author!

## Go for it!
