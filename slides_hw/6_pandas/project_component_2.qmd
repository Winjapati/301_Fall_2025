# Overview

In this component, you’ll use your Python skills (up through **pandas**) to collect and clean your data, producing a tidy `.csv` file that you’ll use for later analysis and visualization.

**Goal:**  

- Gather your raw data  
- Clean and standardize it  
- Export a UTF-8 `.csv` file  

**Deliverables:**

1. `last_name_first_name_component2.qmd`
2. `last_name_first_name_component2.csv`

-------------------------------------

# Instructions

1. Set up Your Project

- Create a folder in your `LIN_301` repo called "course_project".
- Download the data your analyzing into this folder, in `.txt` format.
- Be sure to give your file a short and appropriate name.

2. Using python, write code to open and read your file.

3. It's now time to clean your data and process it as a list.

- Strip all white space and punctuation using `re.split()`.
- Make all characters lowercase.
- Remove empty strings in your list.
- When you’re finished, your list should contain only lowercase word tokens (no punctuation, no empty strings).

4. Convert your list(s) into a pandas `df`.

- You will turn your list of words into a table, including all appropriate `.Series()`.
- Note: exactly **which** `.Series()` you create will depend on your project.
- Include an index.
- Create at least one column with an interesting observation (such as word length, number of vowels, part of speech, frequency, etc.).

5. Save your `df` as `lastname_firstname_component1.csv` to your `LIN_301/course_project` folder.

6. Load up your `.csv` to confirm that everything was processed properly.

7. In your `.qmd` file, explain:

- What your raw file is and where it came from (cite a URL if relevant).
- What cleaning you did (briefly: lowercasing, trimming, regex, tokenizing, etc.).
- What the output CSV contains (columns, rough row count, plus at least one interesting observation).

8. Upload `.qmd` and `.csv` files to Canvas.
