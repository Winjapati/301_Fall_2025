## Download & Load files

```{python}

with open("rom.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    rom = f.read()
    
with open("med.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    med = f.read()
    
print(rom[:100], med[:100])
```

## Split words up, cleaning whitespace & punctuation. Make lowercase.

```{python}

import re

rom_words = re.split(r"[\s\W]+", rom)
rom_clean = [w.lower() for w in rom_words if w]
# rom_clean = [w.lower() for w in rom_words]

med_words = re.split(r"[\s\W]+", med)
med_clean = [w.lower() for w in med_words if w]
# med_clean = [w.lower() for w in med_words]

print(rom_clean[:50], "\n --------------------------------------- \n", med_clean[:50])
```

## How words total? How many unique words?

```{python}

# print("There are", len(rom_clean), "words in Mansfield Park.txt")
# print("There are", len(med_clean), "words in Alice in Wonderland.txt")

print(f"There are {len(rom_clean)} words in Roman Empire. There are {len(med_clean)} words in Mediaeval Church")

unique_rom = []

for wd in rom_clean:
    if wd not in unique_rom:
        unique_rom.append(wd)

unique_med = []

for wd in med_clean:
    if wd not in unique_med:
        unique_med.append(wd)

print("There are", len(unique_rom), "unique words in Roman Empire.txt")
print("There are", len(unique_med), "unique words in Mediaeval Church.txt")


```

## What is the average word length?

```{python}

rom_len = 0
med_len = 0

for wd in rom_clean:
    # rom_len += len(wd)
    rom_len = rom_len + len(wd)
    
for wd in med_clean:
    med_len += len(wd)

print(rom_len, med_len)

print("The average word length in Roman Empire is", rom_len / len(rom_clean), "letters.")
print("The average word length in Mediaeval Church is", med_len / len(med_clean), "letters.")

```

## How many adverbs? Pick three other suffixes.

```{python}

adv_count_rom = 0
wise_count_rom = 0
pst_count_rom = 0
pre_count_rom = 0

for wd in rom_clean:
    if wd.endswith("ly"):
      adv_count_rom += 1
    elif wd.endswith("wise"):
      wise_count_rom += 1
    elif wd.endswith("ed"):
      pst_count_rom += 1
    elif wd.startswith("pre"):
      pre_count_rom += 1

print("In Roman Empire, there are: \n", adv_count_rom,"adverbs in '-ly'\n", wise_count_rom, "forms ending in '-wise'\n", pst_count_rom, "past tense forms in '-ed'\n", "and", pre_count_rom, "forms prefixed with 'pre-'")

print("\n---------------------------------------------------\n")

adv_count_med = 0
wise_count_med = 0
pst_count_med = 0
pre_count_med = 0

for wd in med_clean:
    if wd.endswith("ly"):
      adv_count_med += 1
    elif wd.endswith("wise"):
      wise_count_med += 1
    elif wd.endswith("ed"):
      pst_count_med += 1
    elif wd.startswith("pre"):
      pre_count_med += 1

print("In Mediaeval Church, there are: \n", adv_count_med,"adverbs in '-ly'\n", wise_count_med, "forms ending in '-wise'\n", pst_count_med, "past tense forms in '-ed'\n", "and", pre_count_med, "forms prefixed with 'pre-'")
```

## How much dialogue is there?

```{python}

with open("mansfield_park.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    mans = f.read()
    
with open("alice.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    alice = f.read()
    
mans_quot_count = 0
alice_quot_count = 0
quot_list = ['"', '“', '”']

for c in mans:
    if c in quot_list:
      mans_quot_count += 1

for c in alice:
    if c in quot_list:
      alice_quot_count += 1

print("There are", mans_quot_count / 2, "instances of dialogue in Mansfield Park.")
print("There are", alice_quot_count / 2, "instances of dialogue in Alice in Wonderland.")
```

## What are the most common words (excluding "the", "and", and "of"?)

```{python}
word_counts_med = {}
word_counts_rom = {}
bad_words = ["the", "and", "of"]

for wd in rom_clean:
    if wd in bad_words:
        pass
    elif wd in word_counts_rom:              
        word_counts_rom[wd] += 1
    else:                              
        word_counts_rom[wd] = 1
sort_rom = sorted(word_counts_rom.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

for wd in med_clean:
    if wd in bad_words:
        pass
    elif wd in word_counts_med:              
        word_counts_med[wd] += 1
    else:                              
        word_counts_med[wd] = 1
sort_med = sorted(word_counts_med.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

print("The most common 20 words in Roman Empire are:", sort_rom[:20])
print("The most common 20 words in Mediaeval Church are:", sort_med[:20])
```
