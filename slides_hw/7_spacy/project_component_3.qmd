# Overview

Now that you’ve collected and cleaned your data, it’s time to do some
**actual analysis**. This component is **preliminary**, meaning you’ll
get feedback before your final presentation.

Your job here is to use **Python** to analyze patterns or trends in your
dataset using what you’ve learned so far — including **pandas**,
**WordNet**, and **spaCy** (as appropriate to your data).

# Goal

Use your cleaned `.csv` file from Component 2 to:

-   Load and explore your data;
-   Perform at least two types of quantitative or linguistic analysis;
-   Summarize and visualize your findings in a clear and interpretable
    way;
-   Explain what you found and what you think it means.

# Deliverables

-   `last_name_first_name_component3.qmd`
-   `last_name_first_name_component3.csv` *(if new columns or results
    are saved)*
-   Optional: any figures you generate (e.g., in a `/figures` subfolder)

# Instructions

## 1. Set Up

-   Work inside your existing `course_project` folder.
-   Load your cleaned CSV from Component 2 using `pd.read_csv()`.
-   Confirm that your data appears as expected.

## 2. Plan Your Analysis

Before diving into the code, write a short paragraph (3–5 sentences)
outlining:

-   What you want to learn from your data;

-   Which questions or hypotheses you hope to explore;

-   What results or trends you *expect* to find.

This short plan will help guide your coding decisions and make your
later interpretation clearer.

## 3. Analyze Your Data

Perform at least **two** different analyses. Your exact methods will
depend on your dataset, but here are some examples:

| Type of Data | Possible Analyses |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Word lists | Frequency counts, word length averages, vowel/consonant ratios |
| Text corpora | POS distribution, named entity frequency, most common lemmas |
| Multilingual data | WordNet synonym comparison, translation alignment, semantic similarity |
| Survey/numeric data | Summary statistics, group comparisons, correlations |

You might also:

-   Create a new column (e.g., word frequency, token length, POS tag,
    sentiment score);

-   Filter or group your data (e.g., by language, part of speech, or
    category);

-   Compute descriptive statistics with `df.describe()` or
    `df.value_counts()`.

## 4. Visualize

Include **at least one visualization** using either:

-   `matplotlib` or `pandas.plot()`, or

-   any other tool you prefer (e.g., WordCloud, bar chart, histogram,
    etc.).

Be sure your plot is **labeled and readable** — axis labels, title, etc.

## 5. Interpret

Write a **short paragraph (4–6 sentences)** in your `.qmd` explaining:

-   What questions you asked of your data;

-   What methods or functions you used to answer them;

-   What your analysis revealed (summary of key results);

-   How you might extend or refine this analysis for your final project.

## 6. Save and Verify

-   If you created any new columns or computed results, save them as a
    new `.csv`.

-   Confirm your plots render properly in HTML.

-   Upload all required files to Canvas.
