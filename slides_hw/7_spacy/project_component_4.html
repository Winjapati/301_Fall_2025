  <h1>Final Project Presentation Instructions</h1>

  <h2>Schedule & Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Presentations will take place over the last two class days.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk length:</strong> 7 minutes of presenting + 2 minutes for questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Total time per person:</strong> 9 minutes (hard cutoff).</li>
    <li>Be prepared to present on either day in case we need to shift the schedule.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Website (Instead of Slides)</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of a slide deck, you will build a small <strong>project website</strong> and present it to the class.
    This site will be hosted on your <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> (your <code>username.github.io</code> site).
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your project must be presented as a <strong>website</strong> (HTML/CSS, optionally Quarto).</li>
    <li>The site must be publicly accessible at your GitHub Pages URL.</li>
    <li>The project must have at least <strong>3 distinct sections</strong> (can be separate pages or clearly separated sections on one page):</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dataset</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Methods</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Results & Interpretation</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Suggested Structure</h3>
  <p>You can implement this as multiple pages (e.g., <code>index.html</code>, <code>methods.html</code>, etc.) or as sections on a single page with navigation links.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Home / Overview</strong> (e.g., <code>index.html</code>)
      <ul>
        <li>Project title and your name.</li>
        <li>Short summary of your research question or goal.</li>
        <li>Brief outline of the site (what’s on each page/section).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dataset</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Which text(s) you chose and why.</li>
        <li>Language(s), source(s), and approximate size (words, chapters, sections, etc.).</li>
        <li>How you cleaned the data (tokenization, normalization, encoding issues, etc.).</li>
        <li>Any problems you ran into and how you handled them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Methods</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>What you did in Python, described in plain language.</li>
        <li>Examples: token and type counts, TTR, frequency lists, POS tagging, lemmatization, dependencies.</li>
        <li>Any spaCy or WordNet analyses you used.</li>
        <li>Any custom function(s) you wrote and what they were for.</li>
        <li>You can include short, focused code snippets, but the emphasis should be on what the code <em>does</em>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Results & Interpretation</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>At least <strong>one visualization</strong> (e.g., bar chart, line chart, scatter plot) embedded as an image or HTML output.</li>
        <li>Key numerical results (counts, ratios, patterns, comparisons).</li>
        <li>Clear explanation of what the results <em>mean</em>, not just what they are.</li>
        <li>Discussion of why you think these patterns appear (language properties, translation choices, stylistic differences, etc.).</li>
        <li>Short “What I’d do next” section: follow-up analyses or questions you’d pursue with more time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Presenting Your Website</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>During your 7-minute talk, you will <strong>navigate your own website</strong> on the projector.</li>
    <li>Use your site to guide the story:
      <ul>
        <li>Start on the overview/home section.</li>
        <li>Move to Dataset → Methods → Results & Interpretation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do <strong>not</strong> read the site word-for-word. Use it as a visual outline.</li>
    <li>Keep your explanation focused: <strong>Data → Methods → Results → Interpretation</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design Expectations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The site does <strong>not</strong> need to be fancy, but it should be:
      <ul>
        <li>Readable (good contrast, reasonable font sizes).</li>
        <li>Organized (headings, sections, logical flow).</li>
        <li>Easy to navigate (menu or links to sections/pages).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Basic CSS is encouraged (use your existing course site styles if you like).</li>
    <li>Avoid huge walls of text; break content into paragraphs and bullet points.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Delivery Expectations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay within the time limit: 7 minutes of talking, 2 minutes for questions.</li>
    <li>Speak clearly and at a reasonable pace.</li>
    <li>Assume your audience knows the tools (Python, spaCy, etc.) but not your project.</li>
    <li>Focus on explaining your choices and your reasoning, not just listing steps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Will Be Graded</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> How clearly you explain your project and guide us through the site.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical understanding:</strong> How well you understand what your code and metrics actually do.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality of analysis:</strong> Depth and thoughtfulness of your results and interpretation.</li>
    <li><strong>Website quality:</strong> Organization, readability, navigation, and basic design.</li>
    <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Timing, preparation, and overall delivery.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Submit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A link to your <strong>live GitHub Pages project site</strong> (e.g., <code>https://username.github.io/project-name/</code> or a clearly labeled subpage of your main site).</li>
    <li>A link to your <strong>GitHub repository</strong> containing the project website files (HTML/CSS, images, etc.).</li>
    <li>Submit both links before class on the day of your presentation.</li>
  </ul>
