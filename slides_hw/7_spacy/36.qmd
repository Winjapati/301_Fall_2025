- Designed research questions for your project.
- Interpreted spaCy/WordNet outputs and visualizations.
- Evaluated model errors, tokenization issues, Unicode normalization.


## 4. Equity & Inclusion

You: 

- Worked with multilingual datasets.
- Saw how NLP tools perform differently across languages.
- Observed bias and limitations in certain models (such as spaCy).

## 5. Leadership

# Course Evals

## Thoughts on How this Semester Went

- First time teaching this!  Was definitely a challenge.

## Things that I'll Try Again

- GitHub + GitHub Pages
- Python: same amount of skills
- Group Homework -- perhaps expand?
- Class Projects
  - but needs models!

## Things that I'll Probably Change

- RStudio --> ?
- LaTeX --> Python --> HTML
  - Add an Extra Week for Python
- Less Time with Minutiae, More Time Problem Solving
- Spread Assignments Out Better

## Feedback that I Want from You

- Vibe Coding!
- In your feedback, focus on:
  - one thing you really liked about this course
  - one thing you thing should be improved
