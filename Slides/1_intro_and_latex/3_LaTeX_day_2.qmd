# Review Quiz

-   What did we talk about in Wednesday's class?

## Review of Concepts

-   Documentclass

-   Preamble

-   Packages

-   Comments

-   Commands

-   Environments

# Moving along with LaTeX

## Additional Features

Load up your "example_project". There are lots of features in this document. Scan the code, and identify how to do the following:

1.  "Math Mode"

2.  Changing the margins & paper size

3.  Changing the document language

4.  Spell check settings

5.  Adding citations & references

Identify their type: **commands** or **environments** or **something else**?

## Additional Features: Math Mode

When would you use math mode in Linguistics?

1.  Easy Superscripts & Subscripts

2.  Semantic Formulae

3.  Greek Letters

4.  Primes for intermediate projections / traces in Syntax

## Additional Features: Superscripts & Subscripts in Mathmode

```{latex}
Text$_{subscript}$  

Text$^{superscript}$
```

-   Notice anything special about the mathmode text?

## Additional Features:Superscripts & Subscripts in Textmode

```{latex}
Text\textsubscript{subscript}

Text\textsuperscript{subscript}
```

-   Textmode allows you to maintain the same style

## Additional Features: Semantic Formulae

L(n, j) ∨ C(j)

```{latex}
$L(n, j)\lor C(j)$ 
```

-   The symbol "V" = disjunction (vs. conjunction)

## Additional Features: Greek Letters

Remember "alpha notation" from phonology? We need a way to use these symbols.

```{latex}
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$
```

-   We'll learn in a bit how to input Greek letters outside of mathmode.

-   These are all lowercase – how do you think we can make them uppercase?

## Activity: Math Mode

Return to your "301-LaTeX-practice" project. Create the following semantic notation formula in LaTeX using math mode. Refer to page 31 of [Anke Himmelreich's pdf](https://www.ankehimmelreich.de/downloads/skript_latex.pdf) for the commands.

## Additional Features: Font Effects as Commands

```{latex}
\textit{words in italics} 
\textsl{words slanted} 
\textsc{words in smallcaps}
\textbf{words in bold}
\texttt{words in teletype}
\textsf{sans serif words}
\textrm{roman words}
\underline{underlined words}
\uuline{doubly underlined text}
\uwave{wavy underlined text}
\sout{crossed out text}
\xout{x'd out text}
```

-   You'll notice that while there are line breaks in the code, there aren't in the document. How might you add a line break between each of these lines?

## Additional Features: Line Breaks

```{latex}
\textit{words in italics}

\par \textsl{words slanted}

or

\textit{words in italics}

\textsl{words slanted}
```

-   You can also use \\\\ to signal a linebreak, but it sometimes messes with spacing / document structure.

## Additional Features: Other Types of Break

```{latex}
\pagebreak

\newpage

\clearpage
```
-   

## Additional Features: Font Effects as Environments

```{latex}
\begin{bfseries}
blah blah blah 
\end{bfseries}
\begin{itshape}
blah blah blah
\end{itshape}
\begin{em}
blah blah blah
\end{em}
```
-   If you have large sections of text, it may make sense to do these within an environment instead.

## Additional Features: Font Sizes

```{latex}
{\tiny tiny words} tiny words

{\scriptsize scriptsize words} scriptsize words

{\footnotesize footnotesize words} footnotesize words

{\small small words} small words

{\normalsize normalsize words} normalsize words

{\large large words} large words

{\Large Large words} Large words

{\LARGE LARGE words} LARGE words

{\huge huge words} huge words

```
## Additional Features: Inputting Manual spacing


```{latex}
\vspace{12pt}

Blah blah

\vspace{40mm}

Blah blah

\vspace{12pt}

\hspace{36 mm}

test
```

## Additional Features: Citations

## Additional Features: Tables

```{latex}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
Apples & Green \\
Strawberries & Red \\
Oranges & Orange \\
\end{tabular}
```
## Additional Features: Tables

```{latex}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{rc} \\
Apples & Green \\ 
\hline 
Strawberries & Red \\ 
\cline{1-1} 
Oranges & Orange \\
\\end{tabular}
```

## Additional Features: Tables

```{latex}
\% \centering 
\
\begin{tabular}{\|r\|l\|} % 
\hline 
8 & here's \\ 
\cline{2-2} 
86 & stuff \\ 
\hline \hline 
2008 & now \\ 
\hline 
\
\end{tabular}
```

# LaTeX Packages

-   Allows you to use LaTeX in ways beyond its base features

-   "Declared" in the preamble with the command **\\usepackage{packagename}**

-   Packages often conflict with each other!

-   For this reason, the order in which you install the packages actually does matter.

    -   I really dunno why sometimes.
