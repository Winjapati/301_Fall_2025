# Pretest

-   What is your background in computing?

-   What would you like to get out of the course?

-   This is anonymous, so please answer truthfully!

-   This will help me better understand how to structure the class.


# What is this course?

![](1_comp_ling_battle.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

## In this class, I'm assuming that you ...

-   Know how to use a computer and access the internet;

-   Aren't terribly familiar with the command prompt, and perhaps don't even know what it is;

-   Have never programmed before;

-   Know what generative AI is and have used it before.

## My Background: I am ...

-   A formally trained historical linguist (Ph.D. 2010, UCLA, Indo-European Studies)

-   Specialist in:

    -   Proto-Indo-European

    -   Ancient IE Languages

    -   Historical Phonology

    -   Constructed Languages

    -   Thinking about old problems in new ways

## My Background: I am NOT ...

-   A formally trained computer scientist

-   A formally trained programmer

-   A formally trained computational linguist

## Wait, then why is *this guy* teaching me Computation for Linguists?

-   Despite my lack of formal training in programming

    -   Taught self Python, using online courses & resources

    -   Have studied with specialists (like Dr. Fruehwald!) to learn how computational tools can be used in linguistic work

-   All of this to pursue long-held dream to build a vast database, called "DERBi PIE": a Database of Etymological Roots Beginning in Proto-Indo-European

## DERBi PIE

![](DERBiPIE.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

-   Received funding from the NEH in January 2025 (first try, which is wild, given the 6% acceptance rate!)

    -   Funding pulled with the DOGE-pocalypse in April 2025

    -   What to do? Build the damn thing myself.

## What does that mean in practice?

-   Given that I recently learned how to program, this means that I perhaps better understand the issues that a beginner might have;

-   There may be questions you have that I cannot initially answer, but I will try my best to get you those answers.

## In this class, I'm assuming that you ...

-   Know how to use a computer and access the internet;

-   Aren't terribly familiar with the command prompt, and perhaps don't even know what it is;

-   Have never programmed before;

-   Know what generative AI is and have used it before.

## Why do you need this course?

-   Programming and computing large amounts of data is considering more important these days

    -   Both in linguistics (cf. job market)

    -   And in the regular world!

-   There are quite a few annoying parts of Linguistics that require special tools, think:

    -   IPA symbols

    -   Syntax Trees

    -   Leipzig Glossing Rules

-   Understanding how to use Gen AI as a tool, not as a crutch

## What will you learn in this class?

-   How to compile documents in LaTeX

    -   Word and Google docs are not great for many reasons. Let me show you a better way.

-   How to put together a website

    -   Learning the basics of HTML

-   How to think programmatically:

    -   Python and a little R

    -   How do linguists use computers to work?

# Questions?

# Final Activity: Learning How to Think Like a Computer

-   Consider the meaning of the following sentences:

1.  *It's noisy in here.*

2.  *I'm starving.*

3.  *I have a car.*

## Learning How to Think Like a Computer

-   Now consider how meaning of these sentences changes in different contexts:

1.  *It's noisy in here.* (Statement directed towards friend when going inside a crowded room.)

2.  *I'm starving.* (Statement directed towards friend at 2 pm.)

3.  *I have a car.* (Statement directed towards friend in response to "How are you getting to the party?")

## Learning How to Think Like a Computer

-   How would *you* interpret these in context?

-   How would a *computer* interpret them without context?

## Learning How to Think Like a Computer

-   How would a computer interpret these sentences?

1.  It's noisy in here. (Statement directed towards friend when going inside a crowded room.)

2.  I'm starving. (Statement directed towards friend at 2 pm.)

3.  I have a car. (Statement directed towards friend in response to "How are you getting to the party?")

## Activity: Make Me a Sandwich!

**Goal:** Write instructions that a computer could follow *without guessing* or filling in missing steps.

1.  Form groups of three.

2.  Your task: write step-by-step instructions for making a peanut butter & jelly sandwich.

3.  Be **explicit** — if a step isn’t written, it doesn’t happen.

4.  Remember: A computer will follow your instructions **literally**.

## Activity: Make Me a Sandwich!

**Challenge:**

-   The group with the fewest steps *that still results in a correct sandwich* wins.

-   If your instructions are too short and leave gaps, the “computer” (your instructor) will execute them in unexpected ways!
