Computation for Linguists – Final Project

Final Project: Text Analysis & Visualization
--------------------------------------------
In this project, you will select a dataset (corpus) in a language or languages of your choice
and perform a linguistic analysis using the skills we build in class. Your dataset might be
literary works, song lyrics, transcripts, political speeches, recipes, or any other text source.
The key is that it must be available in a plain text or easily convertible format.

You will:
1. Load and clean your text data using Python.
2. Tokenize the text and extract relevant patterns.
3. Count and summarize those patterns.
4. Visualize your results in R.
5. Present your findings clearly in a short report.

Possible Types of Analysis
--------------------------
You may choose one or more of these approaches for your project:
- **Word frequency & collocations**: Find and chart the most common words, bigrams, and trigrams.
- **Stylistic comparison**: Compare vocabulary richness between two authors, genres, or time periods.
- **Morphological patterns**: Identify and visualize common affixes, endings, or stems.
- **POS-based analysis**: Compare frequency of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. (if using tagged text).
- **Lexical diversity measures**: Calculate and compare type-token ratios or similar metrics.

Skills Used
-----------
- **Python**: file handling, data cleaning, tokenization, regex, counting with Pandas.
- **R**: creating bar charts, word clouds, timelines, and other visualizations.

Project Timeline
----------------
**Week 3:** Choose your dataset and type of analysis.
**Week 9:** Dataset loaded and cleaned; basic pattern extraction and counts completed.
**Week 12:** Visualizations created in R; functions added to automate your analysis.
**Week 15:** Final report and code polished and ready for presentation.

Deliverables
------------
1. A short report (3–5 pages) describing:
   - Your dataset
   - Your analysis steps
   - Your findings (with at least 2–3 visualizations)
   - Any challenges and how you overcame them
2. Your cleaned dataset (or a sample, if large)
3. Your Python and R code, clearly commented

You have freedom to choose:
- The language(s) you analyze
- The genre or domain of the texts
- The specific patterns you focus on

Everything else – the technical steps – will follow the sequence we learn in class.


Computation for Linguists – Final Project Milestone Checklist
=============================================================

Final Project: Text Analysis & Visualization

You will select a dataset in the language(s) of your choice and perform a linguistic analysis 
using the tools and methods we learn in class. Use this checklist to stay on track.

------------------------------------------------------------
WEEK 3 – PROJECT LAUNCH
[ ] Dataset chosen (plain text or convertible to plain text)
[ ] Type of analysis selected (word frequency, morphological patterns, stylistic comparison, etc.)
[ ] Dataset source documented (link, description, or file location)

------------------------------------------------------------
WEEK 9 – CORE ANALYSIS MILESTONE
[ ] Dataset loaded into Python
[ ] Text cleaned (remove punctuation, normalize case, handle special characters)
[ ] Tokenized text stored in a Python data structure
[ ] Pattern extraction complete (regex or other methods)
[ ] Basic counts generated (e.g., word frequency list, affix counts, collocations)
[ ] Preliminary results saved as a CSV for later visualization

------------------------------------------------------------
WEEK 12 – VISUALIZATION MILESTONE
[ ] Visualizations created in R (bar charts, word clouds, timelines, etc.)
[ ] Functions written in Python to automate analysis steps
[ ] Results and visualizations checked for accuracy
[ ] Code is clearly commented and organized

------------------------------------------------------------
WEEK 15 – FINAL DELIVERABLE
[ ] Short report (3–5 pages) written, including:
      - Description of dataset
      - Analysis steps
      - Findings (with 2–3 visualizations)
      - Challenges and solutions
[ ] Cleaned dataset (or sample) ready for submission
[ ] Final Python and R code saved and organized
[ ] Project submitted on time

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- You can only change your dataset/analysis type before Week 6.
- Save your work regularly and push to GitHub after each milestone.
- Ask questions early – debugging is part of the process!
